                                <b>Device Information</b>
                                <p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices that you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalise the content (including ads) or features that you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad that we showed you on your phone on a different device.
                                Information that we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
                                <p>Device attributes: information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
                                <p>Device operations: information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</p>
                                <p>Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network.</p>
                                <p>Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>How Infomation is Shared</b>
                                <p>Advertisers.
                                We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Tera ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>How Tera work together?</b>
                                <p>
                                Terabyte share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Institutions (which include Uni Abuja ...e.t.c) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Ad sector Products that you use. We also process information about you across the Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from Institution about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Tera. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Products, such as understanding the number of unique Clicks on a product and type of Product.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Manage and Delete Info About me?</b>
                                <p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your settings.</p>
                                <p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services or until your account is deleted â€“ whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Tera, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your valid photo ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
                                <p>When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your ads and profile data, and you won't be able to recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the settings.</p>
